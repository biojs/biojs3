Yeah, BioJS is moving forward to have every module as Web Component with Custom Elements!

As an overview you might want to watch _[A jump through web wormholes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zja0ghmVqjw) by [@greenify](github.com/greenify) that givens an introduction why Web Components are the future for BioJS.

What are Web Components?
------------------------

"Web Components are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web." (Wikipedia)

Why Web Components?
-------------------

* __automatic encapsulation__ thanks to the __shadow DOM__ (no more problems with components modifying your site, id conflicts, css conflicts or problems to create multiple instances of a components)
* __Custom DOM Elements__ (new HTML elements e.g. just for biological data)

Everyone is familiar with HTML and can add a `<button>` DOM element to their website. Why not let them add a `<biojs-msa>` element?

Imagine to include an multiple sequence alignment into your website with a short HTML snippet like this:

```
<biojs-msa>
  <biojs-io-fasta url="./Q7T2N8.fasta" />
</biojs-msa>
```

Why now?
--------

* The first official release of Polymer (version 1.0) was at this year's Google I/O (2015-05-29)
* The Polymer project worked hard to reduce the Web Component polyfill to a lightweight shim
* Supported in Chrome since version 36
* Web components will be the __future__!

What is the roadmap?
---------------------

Our roadmap is work in progress, please look at our [github wiki](https://github.com/biojs/biojs3/wiki).

How to help?
------------

Currently there is development and brainstorming is happening [here at github](https://github.com/biojs/biojs3)

* If you have an idea, proposal -> donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue
* IF you want to port your (or a) component to polymer -> go for it & discuss your progress with us here :)
