# BioJS v3

### Mission
Develop an open-source library of components to visualise biological data.

### Vision
BioJSâ€™s vision is that every biological dataset in the world is visualised with BioJS tools.

### Goal
BioJS's goal is to reach as many people as possible, from deeply knowledgeable users to end users who want to implement the component with minimal effort. BioJS aims both for ease of use and extensibility, as so it has to be flexible, maintaining the usability for the less knowledgeable while allowing it to be extended for knowledgeable developers.
